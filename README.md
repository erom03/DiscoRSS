## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Discord bot token with forum channel and message content permissions
    - View [Bot Permissions](#bot-permissions)
- Community discord server

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DiscoRSS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   # Edit .env with your Discord bot token and user ID
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python -m bot.main
   ```

5. **Sync the commands**
   Once the bot is running, do `!sync` to populate the slash commands.
   Note this may take a few minutes.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
token=your-discord-bot-token
userid=your-discord-user-id
POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
```

- `token` - Your Discord bot token from the Discord Developer Portal
- `userid` - Your Discord user ID (for bot owner commands)
- `POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` - How often to check feeds for new content (default: 15 minutes)

## Bot Permissions

Your Discord bot needs the following permissions:
- Send Messages
- Use Slash Commands
- Create Public Threads (for forum posts)
- Manage Threads (for cleanup operations)
- Read Message Contents (This is a privileged intent)

## Commands

All commands require administrator permissions and work in servers with forum channels.

### `/addfeed <forum_channel> <url> [name]`
Add a new RSS feed to monitor.

**Examples:**
```
/addfeed #tech-news https://techcrunch.com/feed/ TechCrunch
/addfeed #updates https://example.com/rss.xml
```

### `/removefeed <number>`
Remove a feed by its display number. Includes confirmation prompt and automatic cleanup of forum posts.

**Example:**
```
/removefeed 2
```

### `/listfeeds`
Display all configured RSS feeds with their numbers, names, and target channels.

**Example output:**
```
Configured feeds:
[1] TechCrunch ‚Üí #tech-news
[2] Science Daily ‚Üí #science
[3] https://example.com/feed.xml ‚Üí #updates
```

## How It Works

1. **Feed Addition** - Administrators add RSS feeds to specific forum channels
2. **Automatic Polling** - Bot checks feeds every X minutes for new content
3. **Forum Posts** - New articles become forum posts with title, content, and discussion threads
4. **Content Formatting** - HTML content is converted to Discord-friendly Markdown
5. **Smart Tracking** - Only posts new content since last check to avoid duplicates

## Database Schema

DiscoRSS uses SQLite with automatic migrations:

- **feeds** - Stores RSS feed configurations and tracking data
- **feed_posts** - Maps forum posts to feeds for cleanup operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding to commands**
- Verify bot token is correct in `.env`
- Ensure bot has proper permissions in the server
- Check bot is online and invited to your server

**Feeds not updating**
- Verify RSS feed URL is accessible
- Check `POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` setting
- Review bot logs for error messages

**Permission errors**
- Ensure bot has forum channel and message content permissions
- Verify you have administrator permissions to use commands

### Logs

The bot logs important events and errors to help with troubleshooting. Check console output for details about:
- Feed polling status
- RSS parsing errors
- Discord API issues
- Database operations
